# wind&sun

## Summary

wind&sun is a tool that helps everyone from home owners to governments make the best decisions when transitioning to renewable energy sources.The main idea will be to have every household powered by solar panels and to bring attention to the cost saving over a pariod of time.

Average US power generation produces 0.39 kg of CO2 emissions per kWh, and costs $12.21 per kWh. wind&sun factors in the carbon cost of solar panel production in the calculation of CO2 reduction estimates.

## Getting Started

Visit [wind&sun](https://team-coffee-reinvent21.vercel.app "wind&sun home") and input an address to generate an estimate.

## Desired features

While our prototype is limited to only offering solar power estimates, there is support to produce similiar estimates for wind power. This will offer a more complete picture of the potential and benefits of converting to renewable soureces.

## Impact - enviornmental sustainability

wind&sun makes it easy to see the impacts of larger scale conversion to renewable energy. It is our experience that when something is easy, it is more likely to be implemented.

## Impact - social sustainability

wind&sun empowers smart decisions around converting to sustainable energy sources, leading to decresing the carbon footprint of households, organizations, and communities.

## Innovation

wind&sun takes the ideas of existing applications (eg [project sunroof](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com)) and increases scale. With wind&sun, the impact of going green is visible not only on the level of the individual, but on the level of neighborhoods, corporations, or municipalities.

## Data usage

wind&sun uses the the [NREL National Solar Radiation Database](https://registry.opendata.aws/nrel-pds-nsrdb/) to provide solar potential estimates for carbon reduction calculations and cost.

## Architecture

wind&sun is lightweight by design, leveraging AWS lambda and next js to minimize resource usage.

## Readiness

While currently wind&sun is a limited prototype, there are [additional datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/nrel-pds-wtk/) to support providing estimates for the adoption of wind power. As well as others renewable energy.
