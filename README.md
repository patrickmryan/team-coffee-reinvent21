# wind&sun

## Summary

wind&sun is a tool that helps everyone from home owners to governments make the best decisions when transitioning to renewable energy sources.

Average US power generation produces 0.39 kg of CO2 emissions per kWh, and costs $12.21 per kWh. wind&sun factors in the carbon cost of solar panel production in the calculation of CO2 reduction estimates.

## Getting Started
Visit [wind&sun](https://team-coffee-reinvent21-bse847tmj-patrickmryan.vercel.app "wind&sun home") and input an address to generate an estimate.

## Desired features
While our prototype is limited to only offering solar power estimates, there is support to produce similiar estimates for wind power. This will offer a more complete picture of the potential of converting to renewable soureces.
